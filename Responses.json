    ,"Philosophy" : "\n\nAcademia\n\nResearch:  The more I learn, the more I do not know.\nTeaching:  One of life's greatest challenges and rewards.\nExams:  A necessary evil.\nRankings:  Biased perceptions.\nPeer review:  Helpful chaos.\nTeacher and Student:  The two most important components of a successful educational career.\n\nTechnology\n\nComputers:  Macs are better than any machine running Windows, including a Mac.  End of story.\nProgramming Languages:  I prefer writing most things in C++.  The most underrated language is COBOL.\nTechie Hours:  Often, people of the technical persuasion do not operate as effectively in the normal 9 - 5 workday as the rest of humanity.  Those who try to fight against it and limit the abilities and nocturnal behavior of such people should wake up and smell the coffee cake.  It is not going to change. My advice to managers, supervisors, etc: welcome it.  You'll be surprised just how many good things can happen when willingness and creativity are given space and time."

I am a technologist who chooses to think critically about technology and encourages others to do the same. \n\nMajor Projects:\n- Assembly Programming and Computer Architecture for Software Engineers (My Book)\n- WordSnapper, a C++ text mining application\n- The Technology & Pop Culture Project (stalled)\n\nTechnical Skills & Interests:\n- C/C++\n- Computer Architecture\n- x86/x86_64 Assembly\n- Text Mining\n- Microcontroller Programming\n- Software Engineering\n- Python\n- Computing Education\n- Web/Services\n- Computing Ethics\n- COBOL\n- Information Theory\n- Database Platforms\n- History\n- LaTeX (scientific writing)\n- Social Movements\n\nI am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Faculty Advisor for the ACM student chapter at Champlain College, and a member of IEEE. I am also a regular reviewer for the academic journal Syllabus."
    ,"Book": "\n\nMy Book\n\nI, along with my co-author Kevin Slonka, wrote the book Assembly Programming and Computer Architecture for Software Engineers. If you are an educator, student, or professional in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field seeking to teach, learn, or study assembly and architecture, then take a look.\nAn overview and details are available on the book website, but here are some highlights.\n\nx86/x86_64 Architecture\n32-bit and 64-bit\nGAS (Clang/LLVM), MASM, and NASM versions of all programs\nPractical Appendices\n\nLinks to resources\nBook Website: http://www.prospectpressvt.com/titles/hall-assembly-programming/\nCode Repository: https://github.com/brianrhall/Assembly\n\nThis page will be updated further upon publication in Spring 2017"
